        Finds multi-word anagrams for the given phrase.

        Args:
            phrase: The input string of letters to anagram.
            must_start_with: A string of characters (e.g., "TRT"). Solutions must contain
                             words starting with these characters, matching counts (e.g., two Ts, one R).
            can_only_ever_start_with: A string of characters (e.g., "ABC"). All words in any
                                      solution must start with one of these characters.
            must_not_start_with: A string of characters (e.g., "XYZ"). No word in any solution
                                 may start with one of these characters.
            max_words: The maximum number of words allowed in a solution.
            output_file: If provided, results are saved to this file. Set to None to disable.

        Returns:
            A string that is path to results txt file.
            Solutions are sorted by quality (fewest words first, then by max length of shortest word).
